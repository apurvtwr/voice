#STD Chlamydia can be transmitted during vaginal  anal  or oral sex  Chlamydia can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal childbirth  
#STD Because the cervix opening to the uterus of teenage girls and young women is not fully matured and is probably more susceptible to infection  they are at particularly high risk for infection if sexually active  Since chlamydia can be transmitted by oral or anal sex  men who have sex with men are also at risk for chlamydial infection  
#STD Chlamydia is known as a  silent  disease because the majority of infected people have no symptoms  
#STD If symptoms do occur  they usually appear within 1 to 3 weeks after exposure
